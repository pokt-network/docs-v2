# The RPC Protocol

The POKT Network protocol first launched on MainNet in July 2020.

A major protocol upgrade, [Shannon](shannon.md), is slated to deploy to MainNet by Q4 of 2024 if not sooner.

### [Morse](morse.md)

We built our live protocol (Morse) on top of the [Tendermint framework](https://tendermint.com/) in the Cosmos ecosystem. Over time, we significantly modified the original Tendermint codebase to optimize it for our specific use case.

Since launch, the protocol has served nearly 700 billion relays on over [50 different chains](../../reference/supported-chains.md), using a network of around 15,000 nodes located in 22 countries.

### [Shannon](shannon.md)

All our expertise is going into a major upgrade we've named Shannon, after mathematician and cryptographer Claude Shannon, the father of information theory.

Shannon is expected to deploy on Celestia's Mocha Testnet in May 2024 and on MainNet later this year.
