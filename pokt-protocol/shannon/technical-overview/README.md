# Technical Overview

Shannon is entering POKT Network into the full Cosmos ecosystem by being built entirely off the Cosmos SDK. Orginally Morse was developed as a fork of Tendermint in 2020. At the time, Tendermint wasn't robust enough to handle all the features POKT Network needed at launch. Features like claim and proof lifecycle had to be hard coded into Tendermint, leaving POKT Network outside of compatibility with the rest of the Cosmos Ecosystem.

Thanks to the technical advancements of the Cosmos SDK over the past several years, POKT Network is now able to be a full member and receive all it’s benefits.

### Shannon Code Base

Shannon is built entirely on the Cosmos SDK. This provides POKT Network with several new benefits (<mark style="color:red;">`MICE`</mark>):

1. <mark style="color:red;">`Modularity`</mark> - The modular design and established framework of the Cosmos SDK make it more inviting for external contributors to join POKT Network.
2. <mark style="color:red;">`Interoperability`</mark> - Through IBC, POKT Network can settle or publish data to other DA networks such as native L1s, Celestia, EigenDA, etc…
3. <mark style="color:red;">`Compatability`</mark> - POKT Network is compatible with any tools or services that are compatible with the Cosmos SDK (wallets, explorers, exchanges, bridges, etc).
4. <mark style="color:red;">`Extensibility`</mark> - Any new features added to the Cosmos SDK in the future can be incorporated into POKT Network.

While Morse was isolated, <mark style="color:red;">`MICE`</mark> grew out through experimentation, so Shannon will be compatible with the larger web3 ecosystem through the Cosmos SDK and IBC. 🐭
