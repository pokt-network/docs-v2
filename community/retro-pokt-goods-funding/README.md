## Applicants Guideline&#x20;

You are only evaluated based on the impact you have already created. Do not mention or allude to your future work or future impact. This is retroactive funding, not proactive funding!

Every type of developer and contributor is eligible for RetroPGF. It doesn’t matter if you’re building a consumer app, a key piece of infra that POKT pays for, or a free-to-use community tool that POKT love or your actions in the DAO or forums.&#x20;

Applications will be assessed by the Foundation before entering the voting pool and after voting concludes. Violating any of the following rules may result in disqualification and removal. Voters are also able to report violations during the voting process which may result in the same outcome. Disqualifications will be published by PNF along with the reasons for disqualification.

1. **Promises of future impact** - You are only evaluated based on the impact you have already created. Do not mention or allude to your future work or future impact. This is retroactive funding, not proactive funding!
2. **False statements & deception** - False claims about your contributions, past impact or funding & grants are not allowed.
3. **Hateful Content** - No racist, sexist, or otherwise hateful speech, no discrimination.
4. **Deceiving Voters** - Malicious content that could cause harm or unintended consequences to users.
5. **Fraud & Impersonation** - Claiming to be a brand or person you are not. The Grant owner must be directly affiliated with the project, the funds must go to the project.
6. **Advertising** - Using RetroPGF application to showcase something you are selling like a token sale or NFT drop.
7. **Bribery** - Bribing voters or vote buying is strictly forbidden.
8. **Contacting voters to promote your application** - Using private channels such as DMs to promote your applications to voters.
9. **Self-dealing** - Voting for your own application (self-dealing) or refusing to comply with the Conflicts Committee's efforts to prevent self-dealing. This includes failing to disclose the existence of Conflicted Voters\* when applying, refusing to disclose the voting addresses of Conflicted Voters if asked by the Conflicts Committee\*\*, or receiving votes from any Conflicted Voter. The Conflicts Committee, not PNF, will be the final authority on self-dealing disqualifications.
   * \*_Conflicted Voters are defined as DAO voters who have a direct interest in an applying organization, either as an employee, contractor or equity holder._
   * _\*\*The Conflicts Committee ensures that PNF is not the unilateral authority on suspected self-dealing activities. The Committee will determine if applications have failed to disclose Conflicted Voters and will inspect the ballots of Conflicted Voters to ensure that no self-dealing votes have been cast._
10. **Refusing to KYC** - The POKT Network Foundation reserves the right to request KYC as part of any risk-based assessment they complete as part of the program. If you are asked to complete KYC and fail to comply, your grant may be returned to the RetroPGF treasury for future rounds. Applications on behalf of a DAO or Foundation will be required to provide proof that the provided wallet addresses are official wallet addresses.
11. **Outside of RetroPGF’s scope** - Contributions that do not have a clear relationship to POKT Network, applications that do not highlight a valid contribution\*\*\*, or contributions which are outside of the RetroPGF scope.
    * _\*\*\*We define contribution as an activity which required a minimum time commitment of 1 hour and which provided impact to POKT. User interactions (e.g. sending transactions) with POKT or wPOKT and staking are not part of the scope of this round_
12. **Spam** - Applications containing spam, such as irrelevant answers, plagiarized content, broken or unrelated impact metrics and contribution links.&#x20;
13. **Languages other than English** - This is the working language of the majority of voters so please ensure you translate any content that is part of your application.
14. **Duplicate applications** - Multiple applications from the same individual, project or group which apply for the same impact. An applicant can list multiple projects as its impact evidence but applying with different applications for the same impact results are not allowed.
